We build the simplest neural network for computer vision (CV) as an introduction to the main motions and jargon of deep learning. This network is a pure feed-forward network, where each pixel has its own input neuron, which is connected via simple weights through the network. It includes visualizing the numeric representation of the images and creating and training a model using stochastic gradient descent.
